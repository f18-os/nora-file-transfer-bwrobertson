This is the Readme for the mutex lab.

Start the mutexServer.py file.
Start the mutexClient.py file.

They should connect as long as you haven't mismatched the ports.

Enter the file you want to send on the client side.
Enter the name you want to save the file as on the server side.
If you mismatch file types, they will still save but you won't be able to read the files until you manually correct their type.
(I.E. png saved as txt)

After the file is saved, the server will listen for a new connection. You can reopen another client to send another file.
